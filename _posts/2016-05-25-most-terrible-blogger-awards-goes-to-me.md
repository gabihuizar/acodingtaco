I have failed this blog. Not only did I stop writing about the Firehose Project, I stopped writing completely. Well I am making a comeback. Bear with me.

I "graduated" from the Firehose Project in January. The program consisted of three applications, test driven development, algorithms, and a final group project. The three applications were a random quote generator, a Yelp clone, and a Udemy clone. The final group project was a chess game. The most challenging part of the program, well the most challenging bits were the Linked Lists & Binary Tree algorithms, and the chess game. I definitely didn't think I was ready to be thrown into that chess game so soon. After I finished the program I didn't feel ready yet. After looking at a lot of job postings around my area, I realized I had to start building projects using JavaScript and jQuery and start learning a JS framework. I went through some of FreeCodeCamp's and theOdinProject's project assignments- I built a calculator and a weather app. I also took some Coursera classes on responsive design as well as interactivity with JavaScript with one of the best Coursera professors ever (Colleen van Lent from the University of Michigan)!

While relearning and playing around with JavaScript, I also started on a passion project. "[TravelThots](http://travelthots.herokuapp.com/)" is like Instagram but for maps of places you've travelled to. I've had so much fun & learned so much from building it and it helped out so much when interviewing. I kept myself busy while unemployed & got more involved with Girl Develop It San Diego. I became a TA for one of their classes, went to Code & Coffee meetups, and took an AngularJS class. Our chapter's co-leader is a tech recruiter at Qualcomm & she announced one day that she had set up three software development/IT internship spots for three GDI members. I applied & after many phone interviews with three different teams, I received an offer! I start next month & I am so excited/nervous/scared/happy to have this opportunity.

If you want to see the projects I've worked on so far, check out my [portfolio site](http://gabycastaneda.com/)! I have a lot of technical topics I am going to try my best to blog about. Stay tuned!
