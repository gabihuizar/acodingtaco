My first month&nbsp;at the Firehose Project has been full&nbsp;of new concepts for me. I started on October 5th. That week&nbsp;I built "Splurty", a web application that spits out travel inspiration quotes or tips with the ability for a user to enter their own advice or favorite travel quotes. The most important take aways from my first week were:

-learning how to set up my environment using VirtualBox and Vagrant

-creating a new Rails web application using MVC (Model View Controller)

-getting used to deploying my code to git and Heroku

I quickly realized the reason for this program's name as I felt like I was hit by a firehose(in a good way). There were a lot of things I &nbsp;didn't completely understand but I trusted the curriculum. My first mentor meeting made me a bit nervous because I didn't know what to expect but he is really nice and willing to help with anything I don't understand.

The second week I started on "Nomster", a Yelp clone with the ability to add places, comments, photos, and user profiles. I called it "BURP!" for breweries. Nomster took much longer than Splurty since it has way more features and there were self-directed lessons which really tested my understanding of the material. I also started on the Object Oriented Programming videos and built a deck of playing cards while struggling to understand Instance Variables and Class Level Methods.

I finished "BURP!"/Nomster in two weeks. I now have a better understanding of how MVC work together to create a web application. Learning about OOP also helps with this because I now see how my Model and Controller's objects can be called from any other part of my application. Using Bootstrap's grid system, modal, and carousel, I was able to get my app to look so much better. Oh and I can't forget to mention Ruby Gems! Using devise, simpleform, geocoder, carrierwave, among others, I was able to implement user login abilities, Google maps, and a picture uploader.

Last&nbsp;week was my fourth week of the program. After finishing the OOP videos on inheritance (Dogs \< Animals), I started on the first code challenge, "Image Blur #1" - an image representation using multi-dimensional arrays:

I was able to figure it out in a day & then I started working on the second challenge. I read all the Ruby Monk lessons and then went ahead and went through the challenges, which were very challenging for me I'm not going to lie. I also started on Code Wars which helped boost my ego after going through Ruby Monk. Before this program I had practiced JavaScript algorithms so I think what is challenging is getting huge blocks of code into sometimes one line as it is usual for Ruby. Next on the curriculum is Test Driven Development - developing by writing tests first.

I am going to try to write more frequently! I just get so busy with classwork :) This month was a reminder of why I started coding in the first place- I love getting challenged & the feeling of success I get once a problem I've been working on gets solved.

Thank you for reading & see you soon :)
