Hello! I'm Gaby. This blog is all about my "learn to code" journey that started about a year ago. I graduated college in May 2014 not knowing what I really wanted to do (like most of my peers) and got a job as an Assistant Media Buyer at an L.A.-based ad agency. I knew right away that media was not the path I wanted for myself so I started Codecademy after my boyfriend suggested I try something called "coding".

The internet taught me the basics. I completed Dr. Chuck's "Programming for Everybody" Python class on Coursera (highly recommend), the JavaScript course on Codecademy, and even signed up for Skillcrush's Web Designer Blueprint (no comment). I found myself coding during my lunch breaks&nbsp;- so I decided to do something about it.

After listening to an alumnus of the Firehose Project on the CodeNewbie podcast, I decided to try out their 2-week free pre-work. Up until then I had started on some beginner JavaScript algorithms but never Ruby. I was completely impressed by their pre-work curriculum! So I quit my advertising job and started The Firehose Project a week & a half ago.
